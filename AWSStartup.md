# Starting Your First AWS EC2 Instance

The AWS `EC2` (Elastic Cloud Compute) provides the ability to "spin-up" a cloud computing resource. This can be very helpful, particularly for long-running code that you do not have the local computing resource/time to execute.  

This document will give an overview of how to start your first `EC2` "instance."  

## Step 1. Create an AWS Account
At this point most people have created a plethora of online user accounts in their lifetime, thus only the high-points of this step will be discussed.  

- An AWS account is *different* than an Amazon(prime) account.
- An AWS account  requires the entering of Credit Card information  
  - There are ways to use AWS without accruing any charges

## Step 2: Log-In to AWS Account
Again this step should be familiar to all.  

- Visit `http://aws.amazon.com`  

At the top of the page you should see:

The orange `Sign In` button is on the upper right.  

Next you will see a password prompt:

Upon login, a search-bar will dominate the middle of what I call the "AWS Dashboard". Typing in `EC2` to that search-bar will provide a quick link to the `EC2` dashboard.
